# ExamplesUsageSOLID
Examples about how to use the following SOLID principles in front-end and back-end applications.

**Single Responsability Princple**

> There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.

**Open-Closed principle**

> Software entities (e.g. classes) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**

> Functions that use pointers or references to bsae classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

**Interface Segregation Principle**

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**

> Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
